					Hi, my name is Mengyu Liang. I recently graduated from the Department of Geography at University of Wisconsin -Madison with a Bachelor of Science Degree. I double majored in Geography and Cartography/GIS, with a concentration in physical geography. Post-graduation, I plan to continue in pursuing a Master's degree in Geography. More specifically, I hope to work on a Master's topic related to environmental remote sensing.

						I have always had a great passion for the scientific research in Antarctica. During the past school year, I was involved in the Antarctica Meteorological Research Center(AMRC) at the Space Science & Engineering Center. I, along with two other cartography students, helped the AMRC group developed an interactive data visualization product that enables scientists to understand the UW's contribution to the Antarctica Automatic Weather Station (AWS) project, as well as helping scientists to download meteorology data more easily. This experience working for AMRC has helped me to gain important insight for understanding the great scientific effort and active research process in this icy continent. The visualization is currently being polished, you will be able to see it on my portfolio pretty soon! 
					</p>

					Additionally, I enjoy learning about new remote sensing techniques. Lately I have been intrigued by using the cutting-edge VIIRS Day/Night band(DNB) on Suomi NPP to analyze effusive volcanic activities. Here is an amazing article on <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/IntotheBlack/" target="_blank">VIIRS Day/Night Band</a> if you are interested in learning more about some applications of DNB. I hope this remote sensing products could be of use for my Masterâ€™s project.

					A little more on my background. My hometown is <a href="assets/kunming.png" target="_blank">Kunming,</a> a city in Southwestern China. Kunming is famous for its natural and cultural attractions. Growing up in Kunming makes me appreciate the beauty of nature and got me interested in learning about the natural landscape of different part of the world. Therefore, I decided to study abroad in the U.S during second year in high school. I have been in the U.S for six years now. I really appreciate the experience of being in a different country and being exposed to a completely different culture.
