					Hi, my name is Mengyu, and I am currently doing my Master's study in the International Cartography M.Sc. Program in Germany. 
                    In May of 2017, I graduated from the Department of Geography at the University of Wisconsin -Madison with a Bachelor of Science Degree (Honors). I double majored in Geography and Cartography/GIS, with a concentration in physical geography during my Bachelor's study. 

					</p>
					
					<br></br>
					<p>
						 The Master program I am currently studying in is a very unique and is designed to train young cartographers from diverse backgrounds on the theories and techniques of cartographic production. It is a program collaborated among the Chair of Cartography at Technical University of Munich (TUM), the Research Group Cartography at Vienna University of Technology (TUW), the Institute of Cartography at Technical University of Dresden (TUD) and the Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation at Technical University of Twente (ITC). The collaborative nature of this program allows me to be exposed to international scientists and new research approaches in the geo-domain. Combining with my undergraduate training in the U.S., I found this experience very valuable to broaden my mind about how geographic research is approached in Europe. During the Master's study, I've had the pleasure to work with 23 other amazing colleagues from 20 different countries! They are each uniquely talented and, moreover, they are willing to share their culture and mind. Now that I am in my third semester of study, I am anticipating to conduct my Master's thesis research in one of these fours institutes with a focus on multimodal remote sensing data and its applications in geography.
					</p>
					
					<br></br>
					<p>
					After graduating from the Master's program in the summer of 2019, I hope to continue my pursuit in Academia in the doctoral level. I am particularly interested in using remote sensing techniques and products to solve geographic problems, as well as involving the cartographic techniques to develop visualizations to communicate the results to various audience effectively. Through both Bachelor's and Master's studies, I have gained exposure to several different remote sensing applications (more details under Resume). I hope through the doctoral study, I could gain more in-depth training in integrating remote sensing techniques and field work to fully answer questions on topics related to climate change and geomorphology.
