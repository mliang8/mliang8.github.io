					Hi, my name is Mengyu, and I’m currently studying in the International Cartography Master Program in Germany. This semester is my third semester in the Master program, and I’m learning about Mobile Cartography and a series of remote sensing techniques utilized in cartographic production at the Technical University of Dresden (TUD). Before this, I have studied web cartography, location-based service at Vienna University of Technology (TUW), as well as cartographic theories and user-centered design at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). Our program is very unique in the sense that it is collaborated among four prestigious research institutes in Europe, and each semester we get to move to a different city and study in one of these schools. The fourth semester, we will choose one of these collaborative schools to conduct Master thesis research. For me, I intend to research on topics related to multimodal remote sensing products and their applications in land use change in Dresden or in Munich. 

					</p>
					
					<br></br>
					<p>
						 Before coming to Europe, I have studied in the U.S. for six years. I first went to the U.S. for high school through an international student exchange program. After I graduated from high school in upstate New York, I went to the University of Wisconsin-Madison to pursue undergraduate study in Geography and Cartography/GIS. The four years in Madison were very influential on my career path because I became deeply passionate for geographic research through geographic coursework and research with faculty members.

					</p>
					
					<br></br>
					<p>
						After finishing the current Master program, I intend to continue pursuing a doctoral degree in geo-related fields in the U.S. In particular, I hope to learn more in-depth the applications of remote sensing techniques in geomorphological research. I think the training I had during both Undergraduate and Master level have prepared well for this further step.

					</p>
					<br></br>
					<p>
						If you are interested in learning about my experience or talking to me about cartography, please feel free to email me! You can also find more information on the Resume and Contact section.
