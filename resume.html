          <h3>Senior Honors Thesis</h3>
          <h4>Interaction of Human Settlement, Vegetation Patterns and Soils in the Northern Minnesota Prairie-Forest Region from the Euro-American Settlement Era to Present</h4>
          <p>Abstract: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
            From studying pollen and charcoal in lake sediments, scientists have reconstructed the past climate, fire frequency and intensity as well as the vegetation patterns in the state of Minnesota. They concluded that the climate was wetter 4000 years ago and fire occurrence was less frequent, and both factors have led to forest invasion into prairie vegetation and shaped the modern day natural land-scape in the region. An additional factor in understanding the past landscape’s relation to the mod-ern landscape is Euro-American settlement and land use in this region over the past two centuries. Both climate- and land-use-induced vegetation change have significantly affected soils, especially their storage of carbon. To reveal more about their interaction, Public Land Survey data and digital soil surveys will be used to study whether there is a mismatch between soil and vegetation patterns during the Euro-American settlement era. The spatiotemporal relationship between soil and vegetation patterns may reflect soils’ delayed response to past vegetation change. The project will then compare the earliest aerial images to the modern day’s images to study the early Euro-American settlement in relation to vegetation and soil, as well as whether this relation has been changing in recent decades. This research is needed in order to understand the effects of past vegetation change and human land use on soils and their carbon storage. </li>
